# Computer_Vision

This repository is created with the intent to develop tutorials for opensource computer vision applications. The list of CV projects is;
- Image classification
- Object Detection
- Semantic Segmentation
- Instanse Segmentation
- Data Generation
- Domain Adaptation

These are the main 6 tasks of CV. For each task, I'll try to create at least one project, keeping in mind that the project is not heavily featured in every tutorial such as MNIST handwritten digit classification.

I'll try to keep it as simple as possible, yet challenging. In each tutorial, not only will I go through every line of code, but will intensionally create errors so that I can show how to handle different errors in CV applications.
